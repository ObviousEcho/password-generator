## What does it do?

This project served as a tool to help grasp and implement foundaional Javascript code.  Starter code was provided in the HTML, CSS, and JS interface functions.  I was responsible for providing logic to enable JS to provide a random grouping of characters based upon user input.

Upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, the user is prompted by JS and asked to enter a password length between 8 and 128 characters.  Through the use of conditional statements, the prompt will only accept valid numbers within the given range.

Users are then prompted for which character types are to be used to generate said password.  Again, through the use of conditional statements, users are prompted accordingly to select from lowercase/uppercase letters, special character sysbols, and numbers.  User input is validated.

After all prompts are answered successfully, a random password is written to HTML.

## What's in the code?

* Pseudo code was writtten to help narrow my focus at the begining of this       project
* Pseudo code evolved into descriptive comments as my code began to take shape
* Globally scoped variables are declared for use in multiple functions
* Variables were also used locally inside of functions as needed
* Javascript methods are used to manipulate strings and arrays
* Several different functions were written, each responsible for a specific segment of code
* Functions were reused where needed, and then called accordingly
* Conditional statements
* Boolean values
* The "return" statement
* The Fisher-Yates algorithm (thanks Google!)
